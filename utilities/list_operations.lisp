; Small Functions which operate on lists

(proclaim '(inline last1 single append1 conc1 mklist))

;; last element in a list
(defun last1 (lst) (car (last lst)))

;; test whether lst is a list of one element
(defun single (lst) (and (consp lst) (not (cdr lst))))

;; attach a new element to end of a list non-destructively
(defun append1 (lst obj) (append lst (list obj)))

;; attach a new element to end of a list destructively
(defun conc1 (lst obj) (nconc lst (list obj)))

;; Ensure obj is a list
(defun mklist (obj) (if (listp obj) obj (list obj)))


; Longer Functions That Operate on Lists

;; Check whether a list x is longer than a list y
(defun longer (x y)
  (labels ((compare (x y)
                    (and (consp x) (or (null y)
                                       (compare (cdr x) (cdr y))))))
    (if (and (listp x) (listp y)) (compare x y) (> (length x) (length y)))))

;; Apply filter function fn to list lst
(defun filter (fn lst)
  (let ((acc nil))
    (dolist (x lst)
      (let ((val (funcall fn x)))
        (if val (push val acc))))
    (nreverse acc)))

;; Groups List into Sublists of Length n, remainder stored in last sublist
(defun group (source n)
  (if (zerop n) (error "Zero length"))
  (labels ((rec (source acc)
                (let ((rest (nthcdr n source)))
                  (if (consp rest)
                    (rec rest (cons (subseq source 0 n) acc))
                    (nreverse (cons source acc))))))
    (if source (rec source nil) nil)))

; Doubly Recursive List Utilities

;; Flatten List lst with Nested Lists
(defun flatten (x)
  (labels ((rec (x acc)
                (cond ((null x) acc)
                      ((atom x) (cons x acc))
                      (t (rec (car x) (rec (cdr x) acc))))))
    (rec x nil)))

;; Prune List with Nested Lists using the function test
(defun prune (test tree)
  (labels ((rec (tree acc)
                (cond ((null tree) (nreverse acc))
                      ((consp (car tree))
                       (rec (cdr tree)
